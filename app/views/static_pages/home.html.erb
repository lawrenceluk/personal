			and been downloaded 20,000 times. Demigods was my personal project up until version 2.0, when I passed the plugin on to new owners.
			<div class="gap"></div>
			<%= link_to "Shipprr", "http://shipprr.com", target: "_blank" %> [2013- ]: a "social media" website that allows users to easily
			create and follow Ships. Based on the relatively recent phenomenon of 
			<%= link_to "relation'shipping'", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipping_(fandom)", target: "_blank" %>
			, fandoms have come up with all kinds of pairings, canon or otherwise, for their favorite characters, celebrities, and even objects. Shipprr seeks to provide a central hub for sorts of fandoms to discuss all the Ships they love. 
			<br>Created with Ruby on Rails and Bootstrap.
			<div class="faded">The site briefly launched in September and was subsequently redesigned. Currently inactive.</div>
			<div class="gap"></div>
			<%= link_to "Vision Dynamics", "http://visiondynamics.cloudvent.net/", target: "_blank" %> [2013]: an optometry website recreated with Bootstrap. The development site with placeholder pages is linked, since the office is still adding more pages to the live version.

			<br>
			Static pages created with plain HTML/CSS.
			<div class="gap"></div>
			<%= link_to "WasItWorth", "http://www.wasitworth.com/", target: "_blank" %> [2013]: the result of a recent hackathon. The goal of the
			site is to provide a place where students can leave short reviews and ratings for individual lectures, allowing other students to decide if it was "worth" going to class that day or not. I completed everything in about 16 hours of work from scratch, with friends doing the stick figure art. 
			<br>
			Created with Ruby on Rails and the Foundation grid.
			<div class="gap"></div>
			<%= link_to "League of Data", "http://leagueofdata.herokuapp.com", target: "_blank" %> [2014]: another hackathon app, this time utilizing Riot's League of Legends API. Enter the name of any player to see a summary of their last ten games, with detailed data and charts visualizing the fluctuation in players' performance over time. The original idea was to learn d3.js and create dynamic graphs for a player's match history, but the goal wasn't met in the given time. Updates are planned for the future that could add this functionality, along with even deeper game analysis.
			<br>
			Created with Zurb Foundation 5, Javascript, Chart.js, and a Rails backend. 
			<div class="faded">Temporarily unusable due to changes in Riot's API.</div>
			<div class="gap"></div>
			<%= link_to "Juiced Up!", juicedup_path, target: "_blank" %> [2013- ]: an incremental game in the style of 
			<%= link_to "Cookie Clicker", "http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/" %>. Players obtain oranges by clicking or idling and turn them into orange juice, which can be spent on upgrades. Through upgrades the amount of Oranges per Second (OpS) and Orange Juice
			per Cycle (OJPC) can be increased, until millions of glasses of orange juice are being produced per cycle. Players can gamble their
			OpS with individual item upgrades and receive Bonuses that further increase OpS and OJPC.
			Over 10,000 plays since release on December 31 2013 and counting!<br>
			Created with Bootstrap (all custom styling), JQuery, and a Rails backend.
			<div class="gap"></div>
			<%= link_to "TwitNow", twitnow_path, target: "_blank" %> [2014]: a one-day "fun project" utilizing 
			<%= link_to "Twitter's REST API", "https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1" %> and
			<%= link_to "Masonry.js", "http://masonry.desandro.com/" %>. TwitNow is a Twitter browser for people who don't really use Twitter (like me). It provides a simple, mobile friendly way to navigate Twitter by hashtags and feeds. Tweets are formatted and laid out by Masonry, creating uniform rows at any resolution. Searches can be sorted by recent, popular, and all, and older tweets can be loaded with AJAX.
			<br>
			Created with Bootstrap grid, JQuery, <%= link_to "Twitter Gem", "https://github.com/sferik/twitter" %>, and Rails backend.

			Created with vanilla HTML, CSS, JQuery, and the Parse API.
			<div class="gap"></div>
			<%= link_to "Dishlist", "http://dishlist.herokuapp.com/", target: "_blank" %> [2014]: a proof-of-concept app for a CS class (CSE 110 Software Engineering). Dishlist is designed for people who want to try multiple items from different restaurants and want a convenient place to remember them. It combines APIs from Yelp, Locu, and Parse to provide cross-platform (Android app in the making) access to a central database. Users can save, like, and dislike dishes and view ratings from other users. Friending functionality is in progress.
			<br>
			Created with Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap (Simplex theme), JQuery, Parse API, Yelp API, Locu API.
			<div class="gap"></div>
			<%= link_to "Emotionall", "http://www.feelemotionall.com/", target: "_blank" %> [2014]: yet another hackathon app, this one combines
			the Twitter, SoundCloud, and Flickr API to deliver content from user searches. Formulated as a simple introduction to RESTful APIs since I was teaching my teammates the basics of Rails.<br>

			<%= link_to "Bintang Badminton", "http://www.bintangbadminton.org/", target: "_blank" %> [2007-2012]: this isn't strictly related but badminton was such a huge part of my life that I'll put it down anyways.
