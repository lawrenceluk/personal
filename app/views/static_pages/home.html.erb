			<%= link_to "Demigods", "http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/demigods/" %> [2011-2012]: a Minecraft server plugin coded in Java. It allows players to alliance with deities from Greek mythology and use special powers in combat with each other. To date, the plugin has received
			<%= link_to "over 200,000 views", "http://www.youtube.com/user/MCtoomuch", target: "_blank" %>
			and been downloaded 20,000 times. Demigods was my personal project up until version 2.0, when I passed the plugin on to new owners.

			<%= link_to "Shipprr", "http://www.shipprr.com" %> [2013- ]: a "social media" website that allows users to easily
			create and follow Ships. Based on the relatively recent phenomenon of relation'shipping', fandoms have come up with all kinds of pairings,
			canon or otherwise, for their favorite characters, celebrities, and even objects. Shipprr seeks to provide a central hub for sorts of fandoms to discuss all the Ships they love. Built in Ruby on Rails with Bootstrap.

			<%= link_to "This Site", "#" %> [2013- ]: Built in Ruby on Rails and Bootstrap (as usual!) with

			<%= link_to "Quadbase", "http://www.quadbase.com/" %> [2011]: a local SaaS business that produces data visualization software. 
			I had a summer internship working on the mobile end of the EspressDashboard platform. In the process I made an iPhone app and a responsive web page with the help of my team members.
			<div class="gap"></div>
			<%= link_to "TouchMedia (cn)", "http://www.touchmedia.cn/" %> [2012]: a company in Shanghai that produces touchscreens that go in
			the passenger headrests of Taxis across China and Canada. As an intern, I ran different touchscreen models through a 
			gamut of tests, everything from simulating monthly data updates and clicking through the proprietary Flash apps looking
			for bugs. I also taught myself Flash/ActionScript while I was there to build a Pong game for the device.
			<div class="gap"></div>
			<%= link_to "Bintang Badminton", "http://www.bintangbadminton.org/" %> [2007-2012]: this isn't strictly related but badminton was
			such a huge part of my life that I'll put it down anyways. Throughout my years of training I reached rank 6th in the United States for
			mens' doubles in my age category, worked as a coach for Bintang Badminton, and volunteered as an umpire at large events.
			<div class="gap"></div>
			<strong>You!</strong> Are you an employer/looking for freelance work? I can do just about anything, and although my first priorities
			are as a student, I'd be more than happy to pick up some side work or a summer internship. Please contact me if you like what you see!
